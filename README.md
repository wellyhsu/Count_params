Due to the large size of the model file, it can't be uploaded to GitHub, so you will need to download it from the google cloud. 
After downloading, please fill in the path of the downloaded model file in "model_path" in count_parameters.py.

If we change the model in the future, weâ€™ll provide a new "model.pth" file. Just update the "model_path" in count_parameters.py to get the new results.
